    question: "What is workflow automation?",
    answer: "Workflow automation is the process of using technology to connect apps, systems, and tasks so they run automatically â€” without manual effort. Think of it as putting your business on \"autopilot\" for repetitive processes."
  },
  {
    question: "How can automation help my business?",
    answer: "Automation helps you:\n\nâ€¢ Save time by eliminating repetitive tasks.\nâ€¢ Reduce errors caused by manual work.\nâ€¢ Improve team productivity and focus.\nâ€¢ Connect tools that don't naturally integrate.\nâ€¢ Scale processes without extra staff."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of automations do you build?",
    answer: "We create customized automations such as:\n\nâ€¢ Sales & CRM: lead capture, pipeline updates, follow-up reminders.\nâ€¢ Marketing: social media posting, email campaigns, audience segmentation.\nâ€¢ Finance & Reporting: invoice processing, expense tracking, dashboards.\nâ€¢ Team Collaboration: notifications, project management, approvals.\nâ€¢ Custom Integrations: connecting unique apps, APIs, or databases.\n\nIf your process is digital, we can probably automate it. ðŸš€"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be technical or know coding?",
    answer: "Not at all. You explain your process, and we design, build, and deliver the automation for you."
  },
  {
    question: "How is automation different from using tools like Zapier?",
    answer: "â€¢ Flexibility: We build solutions tailored exactly to your needs.\nâ€¢ Scalability: Works for startups and enterprises alike.\nâ€¢ Ownership: Your data and workflows remain under your control.\nâ€¢ Cost-effectiveness: Advanced automations without paying per-task limits."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate with my tools?",
    answer: "Yes âœ…. If your tool has an API, webhook, or connector, we can integrate it. We work with CRMs, spreadsheets, cloud apps, databases, chat platforms, and more."
  },
  {
    question: "Is automation secure for sensitive business data?",
    answer: "Yes. We follow strict security best practices and ensure automations are built with data privacy in mind. You always maintain full control over where your data is stored and how it flows. ðŸ”’"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you charge for your services?",
    answer: "We offer:\n\nâ€¢ One-time projects â€“ custom workflow builds tailored to your needs.\nâ€¢ Ongoing support & maintenance â€“ monthly plans to keep automations running smoothly.\nâ€¢ Enterprise solutions â€“ large-scale automation strategies for bigger teams.\n\nPricing depends on complexity, integrations, and support level."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the process if I want to get started?",
    answer: "â€¢ Discovery Call â€“ Understand your goals & processes.\nâ€¢ Workflow Design â€“ Map out your automation.\nâ€¢ Implementation â€“ Build, test, and refine the solution.\nâ€¢ Delivery & Training â€“ Ensure your team can use it confidently.\nâ€¢ Ongoing Support (optional) â€“ Continuous monitoring and improvements."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide long-term support?",
    answer: "Yes. We can either train your team to manage automations or provide ongoing support where we handle everything for you."
